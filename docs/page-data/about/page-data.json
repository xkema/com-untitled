The problem was that she had never considered all the downsides to actually being famous. <strong>All you need to do is</strong> pick up the pen and begin. The sunblock was handed to the girl before practice, but the burned skin was proof she did not apply it. There was coal in his stocking and he was thrilled.</p>\n<p>Had she taken the time to objectively consider these downsides, she would have never agreed to publically sing that first song.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1024px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.796875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Please always fill the alternative text attributes!\"\n        title=\"Hola gatsby-remark-images plugin!\"\n        src=\"/com-untitled/static/7c8f209ff61666ec04c4e3ddc6c3fbc8/72e01/priscilla-du-preez-dlxlgiy-2vu-unsplash.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/com-untitled/static/7c8f209ff61666ec04c4e3ddc6c3fbc8/e4a55/priscilla-du-preez-dlxlgiy-2vu-unsplash.jpg 256w,\n/com-untitled/static/7c8f209ff61666ec04c4e3ddc6c3fbc8/36dd4/priscilla-du-preez-dlxlgiy-2vu-unsplash.jpg 512w,\n/com-untitled/static/7c8f209ff61666ec04c4e3ddc6c3fbc8/72e01/priscilla-du-preez-dlxlgiy-2vu-unsplash.jpg 1024w,\n/com-untitled/static/7c8f209ff61666ec04c4e3ddc6c3fbc8/ac99c/priscilla-du-preez-dlxlgiy-2vu-unsplash.jpg 1536w,\n/com-untitled/static/7c8f209ff61666ec04c4e3ddc6c3fbc8/0f98f/priscilla-du-preez-dlxlgiy-2vu-unsplash.jpg 1920w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">Hola gatsby-remark-images plugin!</figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<p>The rain was coming. Everyone thought this would be a good thing. It hadn't rained in months and the earth was dry as a bone. It wasn't a surprise that everyone thought a good rain was what was needed, but they never expected how much rain would actually arrive.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There weren't supposed to be dragons flying in the sky. First and foremost, dragons didn't exist. They were mythical creatures from fantasy books like unicorns. This was something that Pete knew in his heart to be true so he was having a difficult time acknowledging that there were actually fire-breathing dragons flying in the sky above him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There was a leak in the boat. Nobody had yet noticed it, and nobody would for the next couple of hours. This was a problem since the boat was heading out to sea and while the leak was quite small at the moment, it would be much larger when it was ultimately discovered. John had planned it exactly this way.</p>\n<p>\"It's never good to give them details,\" Janice told her sister. \"Always be a little vague and keep them guessing.\" Her sister listened intently and nodded in agreement. She didn't fully understand what her sister was saying but that didn't matter. She loved her so much that she would have agreed to whatever came out of her mouth.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sometimes it just doesn't make sense. The man walking down the street in a banana suit. The llama standing in the middle of the road. The fairies dancing in front of the car window. The fact that all of this was actually happening and wasn't a dream.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's an unfortunate reality that we don't teach people how to make money (beyond getting a 9 to 5 job) as part of our education system. The truth is there are a lot of different, legitimate ways to make money. That doesn't mean they are easy and that you won't have to work hard to succeed, but it does mean that if you're willing to open your mind a bit you don't have to be stuck in an office from 9 to 5 for the next fifty years o your life.</p>\n<p>The blinking light caught her attention. She thought about it a bit and couldn't remember ever noticing it before. That was strange since it was obvious the flashing light had been there for years. Now she wondered how she missed it for that amount of time and what other things in her small town she had failed to notice.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>She put the pen to paper but she couldn't bring herself to actually write anything.</li>\n<li>She just stared at the blank card and wondered what words she could write that would help in even a small way.</li>\n<li>She thought of a dozen ways to begin but none seemed to do justice to the situation.</li>\n<li>There were no words that could help and she knew it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>There was little doubt that the bridge was unsafe. All one had to do was look at it to know that with certainty. Yet Bob didn't see another option.</em> He may have been able to work one out if he had a bit of time to think things through, but time was something he didn't have. A choice needed to be made, and it needed to be made quickly.</p>\n<p>The thing that's great about this job is the time sourcing the items involves no traveling. I just look online to buy it. It's really as simple as that. While everyone else is searching for what they can sell, I sit in front of my computer and buy better stuff for less money and spend a fraction of the time doing it.</p>\n<p>She looked at her little girl who was about to become a teen. She tried to think back to when the girl had been younger but failed to pinpoint the exact moment when she had become a little too big to pick up and carry. It hit her all at once. She was no longer a little girl and she stood there speechless with fear, sadness, and pride all running through her at the same time.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"pageId":"243e175c-9a05-5119-a37e-02554e42913c"}},"staticQueryHashes":["4222600930"]}
